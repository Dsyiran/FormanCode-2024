    <h2> Week 1 drawing piece. </h2>

    <p>From using the P5.JS for coding a drawing, I think the most important thing that I learned is to think in the way of grid and scale. When doing the coding, the page set up at the very beginning decides all the following data you will type about the location and scale. Once you want to change any of the variables during the coding, you need to change all of them. For our homework this time, as we are doing pixel art originally from the Google sheet, so we need to calculate the scales as grids. However, on the other side, because our coding sheet is based on points, we need to code in the way of points. This commands the transition between grid-scale and point scale. It is quite interesting.<p>
