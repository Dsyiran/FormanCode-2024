    <h2> Week 2 drawing piece (Creator: Simon Deng; Partner: Aeir Gong). </h2>

    <p>When doing the homework for the second week, I needed to turn an abstract and incorporeal "lost object" into a painting and reproduce it in p5.js through the text description from my partner. Similar to the first week last time, it is inevitable to encounter problems that cannot be realized due to irrational descriptions. For example, what is the curvature of the edge of the doll I need to reproduce, whether the posture is standing or sitting, etc? How big is it and what are its proportions? These all need to be decided by my imagination during the programming process. But I felt like the instructions laid out the key information about the doll, so I had a rough blueprint in my mind.<p>
